# Software Engineering Oblig 3

## Project Descrpition
  A school assignment where we have to create a gitgub repository for a previous assignment, 
  and set it up to run the tests of the program through git hub actions every time a commit is pushed.
  
## How i did this:
I did this by creating a new repository called "HaakonNerby_Oblig3" through pycharm and pushed this to my account.
After this i navigated to the actions-tab of the repository on github.com to setup a new workflow. 
Here i selected the workflow called Python Application, and clicked "Start Commit", followed by "Commit new file".
This created a new file called python-app.yml in the workflow-folder, located inside the .github folder. After the yml-file was done running, the setup was complete.
